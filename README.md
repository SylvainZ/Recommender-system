Details for csv file :

-item_matrix.csv is the attributes of each movie
-occurence files contains the ocurrence with the method in Manuel Pozo thesis 
-for the files with sentiment : sentiments for each film are between 0 and 100, so I set to 1 or 0 according to the threshold 30, 50, 60, 70 and applied the same method for occurence.
-Weight files are computed with PCA, also explained in Manuel Pozo thesis.
